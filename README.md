Weather Widget

You have to use React.js + necessary dependencies (your own preferences) to complete this task, DON’T use ‘Create React App’ or any sort of boilerplate (except your own + provide a link to github/bitbucket repository).

Implement SPA application - weather widget.
There should be the form to enter a location in the upper part of the screen (text field + buttons). Right under, there should be a section with tabs to switch between locations. 
Initially, there should be 2 tabs with city names (for example New York, USA and Toronto, Canada). 
When the tab is active weather data for selected location should be presented on the page. You can use open weather resources (like http://openweathermap.org/current). If you enter valid city name into location text field and press submit button, tab with that city name should be added. In the tab, there should be an 'X' in the right upper corner (like in chrome web browser), when 'X' is clicked - tab should be deleted. Tabs should persist after page reload (F5) + active tab should be the same as before reload.
The web application should be stylized and has modern look.
